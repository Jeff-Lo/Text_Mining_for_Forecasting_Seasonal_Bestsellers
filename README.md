# Text Mining for Forecasting Seasonal Bestsellers

## Background
This is a project for implementing text mining for forecasting seasonal bestsellers via deep learning AI model. Initially, we generated embedding of text data via Bert, and conducted data preprocessing for the overall dataset. Subsequently, we implemented time-series analysis, and utilized Tensorflow to forecast future seasonal bestsellers.
